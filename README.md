# rust-tetris-sdl
Rust Tetris game via simple SDL2

I enjoyed this so much. I always wanted to create game. Before this, I tried few javascript, following tutorials. But this time, in Rust, I decided not to follow any tutorial and not to use any game library.
I picked SDL2 and tried to code Tetris. The code algoritm is not good at all. I am hacking vectors and counting collision in a weird ways. There are much better algoritms for this, for sure.
But this wasn't the point. I was learning Rust along learning Tetris and whole SDL2. And this project used so well. I had a lot of motivation while coding this simple Tetris. Games are fun!
